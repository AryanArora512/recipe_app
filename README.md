# recipe_app

This project involves the development of a recipe app using Flutter and the Edamam API. The app will allow users to search for recipes based on various criteria such as ingredients, dietary restrictions, and cuisine type. The app will also provide nutritional information for each recipe and allow users to save their favorite recipes for future reference. The use of Flutter will allow for a smooth and responsive user interface, while the Edamam API will provide a vast database of high-quality recipes and nutritional information to enhance the user experience.

A new Flutter project.
